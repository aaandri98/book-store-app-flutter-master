Flutter demo project for Tutored Webinar!
## How to start the project

To start the app, make sure to have the correct Flutter environment in your pc.
Here is a guide to do set it up:
- [Install Flutter on your PC](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

When you have all ready, clone this repo and run this commands in the project folder:

```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Flutter run needs a device to install the app, so make sure you have an emulator active or a connected physical device (already set up with enalbed debug USB).
